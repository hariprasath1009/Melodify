MELODIFY

Melodify is a web-based platform designed for music and movie categorization, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to easily explore and browse:

Music Section: Songs categorized by actor/actress, music director, lyricist, and playback singer.

Movie Section: Movies sorted by language, with additional filtering by actor/actress, director, and recent releases.

The goal of the project is to provide a user-friendly interface for discovering and sorting content, offering an engaging experience for users passionate about music and movies.
