                Visaranai is a 2015 Indian Tamil-language crime drama film written and directed by Vetrimaaran. It is based on the novel Lock Up by M. Chandrakumar. The film stars Dinesh, Anandhi, Samuthirakani, Aadukalam Murugadoss, Kishore, Pradheesh Raj, and Silambarasan Rathnasamy. The film deals with the lives of two men before and after being thrown into a kafkaesque scenario in which they get tortured for confession. Vetrimaaran later told that, in the beating sequences in the film, the actors were really beaten (which was criticized by some of the foreign media and a member of Golden Globes during the film's Oscar campaign), and all of them had to undergo counselling sessions.
